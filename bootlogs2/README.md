When stuck in bootloop, just boot back to recovery, mount vendor and then flash this logcat zip file and reboot to system. Wait for sometime in boot stuck and then boot back to recovery

Go to cache folder in recovery and u can see log txt file, copy it to sd card

If with enforcing selinux no log is captured, try with permissive
